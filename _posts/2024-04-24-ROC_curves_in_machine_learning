# **ROC curves in machine learning**
## **What is the ROC curve?**
**Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC)** curves are graphs that show the performance of a classifier by plotting the true positive and false positive rates.    
The area under the ROC curve (AUC) measures the performance of a machine learning algorithm. ROC curves visualize the statistical accuracy of classifier selection.
